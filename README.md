# Description

For this project it will be created an entire web page from a design provided by OTP. A couple images will be provided and the objective is to get as close as possible to that design. The point of this project is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

# Goals

- Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

- One section at a time. The website has 4 main sections (and a footer). Ideally focus in one section and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

- For the section we're working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. Youâ€™ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration.
